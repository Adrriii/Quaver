# Quaver Offline

## About 

**Quaver** is a community-driven and open-source competitive vertical scrolling rhythm game with two game modes and online leaderboards. It also features an in-game editor and a flexible multiplayer mode.

It is also being officially released on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/980610/Quaver/) for Windows, Mac, and Linuxâ€”making it one of the most accessible community-driven rhythm games to date.

This is the Offline version, which includes only limited features but doesn't rely on steam running in the background !

## Status

This project will likely not be heavily maintained, you might want to use the official client for that. This project is here for the sake of existing.

## Features

Those are the features still present in this version :

* **Two Game Modes** - Play the game with 4 keys or challenge yourself with 7. Each game mode has separate global and country leaderboards to compete on.

* **Map Editor** - Create your own maps to any of your favorite songs. Upload and share them with the world, and submit them for official ranking.

* **Advanced Skinning System** - Completely customize your gameplay experience with the ability to create skins. Export and share your skins with friends or upload them to the Steam workshop.

* **Replays** - Go back in time by watching your previous scores. Watch replays from other players around the world, or export your own and share them with your rivals.

* **Over 10+ Game Modifiers** - Switch up the way you play by activating in-game modifiers. Customize the speed of the song, get rid of all the long notes, or even randomize the entire map

* **Play Maps From Other Games** - Coming from a different game and miss all of your favorite maps? Quaver supports .osz, .sm, and .mc/.mcz files out of the box - with support for more games to be added in the future!
